I'm an engineer with interest in working with state-of-art back end, DevOps and IaC tech such as Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS... you name it. In the past few years (past 2020), most of my work has been centered around various Enterprise Machine Learning projects where I usually have been in charge of AWS/Azure infrastructure, Kubernetes administration and such. Every now and then, I do front end stuff as well such as this website. Long time ago, I have also dabbled with mobile app development or even Blockchain development (tbf, there was an era when we thought Blockchain could do something productive one day). When I'm not busy writing and fixing my own code, you may find me running, cooking or volunteering for the wonderful Redi organization in Berlin."
