I'm a developer with interest in working with state-of-art back end and DevOps tech such as Kubernetes, containers, AWS... you name it. Occasionally, I do front end stuff as well such as this website. In the past I have tapped into Blockchain/Ethereum, mobile app development for Android. When I'm not busy writing and afterwards fixing my own code, you may find me running, listening to semi-obscure music or doing the latter two things at the same time."
